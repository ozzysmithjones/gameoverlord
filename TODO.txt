TODO/IDEAS:

- Possibly make a tool for making animations with sprite sheets. (selecting a region of the sprite sheet to be used as an animation).
- Enable the ability swap out different game projects at runtime (not just hot-reload one project). Some kind of file explorer functionality
to load a game.
- Some kind of particle effect system using compute shaders to generate vertex/instance buffers that is then consumed by the graphics pipeline.
- level editor. Could provide some kind of entity layout during game init so the level editor knows what layout the entities are and what they contain for display purposes.
